Summary: In the early days of the data and analytics space, comprehensive data catalogs were hard to come by. Trying to understand the data that was available to you, which data you should be using, and how best to use that data was a full time job in and unto itself. This quest for information usually entailed sifting through pages of technical documentation and/or doing some light sleuthing to find someone who knew something about the data.
Key Features:
• . In tandem with these efforts, we are also working on adding support for Starburst in Collibra Data Quality & Observability so data citizens can gain deeper understanding and trust of the data they are working with
• . Additionally, there are plans to provide advanced governance capabilities through a native integration between Starburst and Collibra Protect, which will centralize access controls for all of your data sources and provide an audit trail for any access requests
Executive Insight: This announcement highlights new capabilities or strategic direction relevant to customers or the business.
