Summary: What’s changed is more and more use cases are able to be served from an open data lake by numerous engines with features such as ACID transactions, higher performance (ssd caching and indexing) and enterprise-grade security thanks to table formats like Iceberg, Delta Lake and Hudi.
Key Features:
• What’s changed is more and more use cases are able to be served from an open data lake by numerous engines with features such as ACID transactions, higher performance (ssd caching and indexing) and enterprise-grade security thanks to table formats like Iceberg, Delta Lake and Hudi.
• Some points: Previously closed architectures like Snowflake , BigQuery, etc.. are starting to get on board and supporting external customer storage.
• In addition to OLAP, we have other technologies such as search and purpose-built applications like Data Dog,etc.. There are many other lake engines but they need to support the table formats I listed above in order to be considered supporting an “open” architecture One gotcha is who is going to “own” your table metadata.
Executive Insight: This announcement highlights new capabilities or strategic direction relevant to customers or the business.
