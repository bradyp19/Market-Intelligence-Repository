Summary: Last June, we announced Databricks AI/BI, our entry into the Business Intelligence category, built around AI that deeply understands your data, semantics and usage patterns, and architected from the ground up to leverage the Data Intelligence Platform. AI/BI not only offers a conventional BI experience through Dashboards, it also features Genie, a conversational analytics experience that enables everyone to answer their own data questions through natural language. Today, we’re thrilled to share that AI/BI Genie will now join AI/BI Dashboards as Generally Available on all clouds.
Key Features:
• . We have also delivered a range of other enhancements—from improved visualizations to a redesigned user interface to guide end users through their analysis
• . For example, we’ve added support for Unity Catalog Metrics , allowing customers to use governed, trusted data models to ensure accuracy for critical use cases
• . Genie everywhere: Dashboards and Genie work better together—which is why every AI/BI Dashboard includes an integrated Genie space
Executive Insight: This announcement highlights new capabilities or strategic direction relevant to customers or the business.
