Summary: In this blog, we propose a new architecture for OLTP databases called a lakebase. A lakebase is defined by:

Openness : Lakebases are built on open source standards, e.g. Postgres.

 Separation of storage and compute : Lakebases store their data in modern data lakes (object stores) in open formats, which enables scaling compute and storage separately, leading to lower TCO and eliminating lock-in.
Key Features:
â€¢ . Lakehouse integration: Lakebases should make it easy to combine operational, analytical, and AI systems without complex ETL pipelines
Executive Insight: This announcement highlights new capabilities or strategic direction relevant to customers or the business.
